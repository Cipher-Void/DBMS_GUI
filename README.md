<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>
     In the digital age, data is a pivotal asset for any organization. Effective data management and retrieval are crucial for informed decision-making, streamlined operations, and achieving strategic objectives. A Database Management System (DBMS) plays a central role in this context by providing the necessary tools and methodologies for organizing, storing, and manipulating data efficiently.
</p>
<p>
     This project aims to develop a comprehensive DBMS application tailored to address specific requirements of a chosen domain. By leveraging advanced database
     technologies and principles, and integrating a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), this project will illustrate the practical applications and benefits of
     DBMS in real-world scenarios.
